# MLB Pitch Data Exploration
## by Andrew Schutte


## Dataset

> This dataset was scrapped from MLB gameday info and put on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018). This dataset has all of the metrics which are tracked on each baseball throw during a game. MLB teams use this data to evaluate their pitchers. There is also information about the results of each pitch/atbat along with game information such as temperature, time, and who played who.


## Summary of Findings

> I examined the distributions of variables which could lead to the effectiveness of each pitch. I also looked at the different results of each pitch and atbats and their frequency. I tried to look at some variables which would lead to movement on each pitch. I struggled to find a good trend or correlation. Some of that is due to the data and the complexity of it. I did find some good visualizations with the location of each pitch type. I also looked at the grade given to each pitch (nasty). This game me some interesting insight to what location of pitches is best.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> I want to polish the plots for the distributions of my start and end speed of pitches. i then want to show the pitch types and their specific start/end speed distributions. I'll then move over to looking at atbat/pitch results. I'll split this up by pitch type again. Finally, I'll look at the location of each pitch and the frequency. I then want to look at which locations are best based on the 'nasty' variable. I want to change my individual pitch start/end speed charts to a box plot instead of a violin plot. I think this just looks better.
